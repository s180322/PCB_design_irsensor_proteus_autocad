IR sensor is an electronic device, that emits the light in order to sense some object of the surroundings. An IR sensor can measure the heat of an object as well as detects the motion. Usually, in the infrared spectrum, all the objects radiate some form of thermal radiation. These types of radiations are invisible to our eyes, but infrared sensor can detect these radiations.

I designed a pcb for irsensor using proteus software.In this repo I attached the following files 

1)Bill Of Materials 

2)Project Planning 

3)Basic Schematic

4)PCB Layout
